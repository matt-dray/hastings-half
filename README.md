# hastings-half

A [small R Markdown page](https://matt-dray.github.io/hastings-half/) with interactive maps of the [Hastings Half Marathon](https://www.hastings-half.co.uk/), which I ran in March 2022 for [Sands UK](https://www.sands.org.uk/). 

I captured the geolocation data via Apple Watch, extracted it with [{gpx3d}](https://matt-dray.github.io/gpx3d/) and plotted it with [{leaflet}](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) and [{plotly}](https://plotly.com/r/).

You might still be able to [donate on my JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/matt-dray) if you want to.
